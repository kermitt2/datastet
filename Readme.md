DataStet is originally a fork from [dataseer-ml](https://github.com/dataseer/dataseer-ml). This extended version aims at identifying every mention of datasets in scientific documents, including implicit mentions of datasets (introduction of data created/used in the research work, but not named) and explicitly named dataset. In addition, this version includes an automatic characterization of the mention context. 

Most of the datasets discussed in scientific articles are actually not named, but these data are part of the disclosed scientific work and should be shared properly to meet the [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) requirements. Named dataset are particularly useful to evaluate the impact of a datasets in other research works and to credit researchers developing datasets as valuable scientific contributions (beyond just scholar publications).

Mentions of dataset are characterized automatically as _used_ or not in the research work described in the scientific document, _created_ and _shared_. 

The identified datasets are further classified in a hierarchy of dataset types, these data types being directly derived from MeSH.

The module can process a variety of scientific article formats, including mainstream publisher's native XML submission formats: PDF, TEI, JATS/NLM, ScholarOne, BMJ, Elsevier staging format, OUP, PNAS, RSC, Sage, Wiley, etc. PDF is considered as the "universal" scientific document format, but it is also the most challenging one. We use GROBID to process and structure efficiently and reliably PDF. 

The back-end service remain compatible with [dataseer-ml](https://github.com/dataseer/dataseer-ml) and the [DataSeer-Web application](https://github.com/dataseer/dataseer-web).  

Note: `.docx` format is also supported in a GROBID specific branch, but not yet merged. 

## Run with docker

The easiest way to deploy and run the service is to use the Docker image. 

It's possible to use a Docker image via [docker HUB](https://hub.docker.com/r/grobid/datastet), pull the image (5.25GB) as follow: 

```bash
docker pull grobid/datastet:0.8.1
```

(check the latest version on project's [docker HUB](https://hub.docker.com/r/grobid/datastet)!)

After pulling or building the Docker image, you can now run the `datastet` service as a container:

```bash
>  docker run --rm --gpus all -it --init --ulimit core=0 -p 8060:8060 grobid/datastet:0.8.1
```

The build image includes the automatic support of GPU when available on the host machine via the parameter `--gpus all` (with automatic recognition of the CUDA version), with fall back to CPU if GPU are not available. The support of GPU is only available on Linux host machine.

The `datastet` service is available at the default host/port `localhost:8060`, but it is possible to map the port at launch time of the container as follow:

```bash
> docker run --rm --gpus all -it --init --ulimit core=0 -p 8080:8060 grobid/datastet:0.8.1
```

By default, BidLSTM-CFR with ELMo model if used for the dataset mention recognition (it performs better than SciBERT with 3 points F1-score). Every classification models are fine-tuned SciBERT models. To modify the configuration without rebuilding the image - for instance rather use the SciBERT model, it is possible to mount a modified config file at launch as follow: 

```bash
> docker run --rm --gpus all -it --init --ulimit core=0 -p 8060:8060 -v /home/lopez/grobid/datastet/resources/config/config.yml:/opt/grobid/datastet/resources/config/config.yml:ro  grobid/datastet:0.8.1
```

As an alterntive, a docker image for the `datastet` service can be built with the project Dockerfile to match the current master version. The complete process is as follow: 

- copy the `Dockerfile.datastet` at the root of the GROBID installation:

```bash
~/grobid/datastet$ cp ./Dockerfile.datastet ..
```

- from the GROBID root installation (`grobid/`), launch the docker build:

```bash
> docker build -t grobid/datastet:0.8.1 --build-arg GROBID_VERSION=0.8.1 --file Dockerfile.datastet .
```

The Docker image build take several minutes, installing GROBID, datastet, a complete Python Deep Learning environment based on [DeLFT](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft) and deep learning models downloaded from the internet (one fine-tuned model with a BERT layer has a size of around 400 MB). The resulting image is thus very large, more than 10GB, due to the deep learning resources and models. 

## Build & Run

Building the module requires JDK 1.8 or higher. First install and build the latest development version of GROBID (currently `0.7.3-SNAPSHOT`) as explained by the [documentation](http://grobid.readthedocs.org), together with [DeLFT](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft) (currently version `0.3.2`) for Deep Learning model support.

Under the installed and built `grobid/` directory, clone the present module `datastet` (it will appear as sibling sub-project to grobid-core, grobid-trainer, etc.):

> cd grobid/

> git clone https://github.com/kermitt2/datastet

Download from AWS S3 and install the trained models in the standard grobid-home path:

> ./gradlew installModels 

Try compiling everything with:

> ./gradlew clean install 

Run some test: 

> ./gradlew test

To start the service:

> ./gradlew run

## Console web app

Javascript demo/console web app is then accessible at ```http://localhost:8060```. From the console and the `Dataset services` tab, you can process chunk of text (select `Process text sentence`) or process a complete PDF document (select `process PDF`). 

Legacy Dataseer services are available with the `Dataseer services` tab. 

## JSON format for the extracted software mention

The resulting dataset mention extractions include various attributes and information. These extractions follow the [JSON format documented on this page](https://github.com/kermitt2/datastet/blob/master/doc/annotation_schema.md). 

## Web API

### /service/annotateDatasetSentence

Identify the dataset information in a sentence and optionally disambiguate the extracted dataset mentions against Wikidata.  

|  method   |  request type         |  response type     |  parameters            |  requirement  |  description  |
|---        |---                    |---                 |---                     |---            |---            |
| GET, POST | `multipart/form-data` | `application/json` | `text`            | required      | the text to be processed |
|           |                       |                    | `disambiguate` | optional      | `disambiguate` is a string of value `0` (no disambiguation, default value) or `1` (disambiguate and inject Wikidata entity id and Wikipedia pageId) |

Response status codes:

|     HTTP Status code |   reason                                               |
|---                   |---                                                     |
|         200          |     Successful operation.                              |
|         204          |     Process was completed, but no content could be extracted and structured |
|         400          |     Wrong request, missing parameters, missing header  |
|         500          |     Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message           |
|         503          |     The service is not available, which usually means that all the threads are currently used                       |

A `503` error normally means that all the threads available to Softcite service are currently used for processing concurrent requests. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 1 seconds for the `annotateDatasetSentence` service.

Using ```curl``` POST/GET requests with some __text__:

```console
curl -X POST -d "text=Insulin levels of all samples were measured by ELISA kit (Mercodia)." localhost:8060/service/annotateDatasetSentence
```

```console
curl -GET --data-urlencode "text=Insulin levels of all samples were measured by ELISA kit (Mercodia)." localhost:8060/service/annotateDatasetSentence
```

which should return this:

```json
{
  "application" : "datastet",
  "version" : "0.7.2-SNAPSHOT",
  "date" : "2022-06-15T12:25+0000",
  "mentions" : [ {
    "rawForm" : "Insulin levels",
    "type" : "dataset-implicit",
    "dataset-implicit" : {
      "rawForm" : "Insulin levels",
      "normalizedForm" : "Insulin levels",
      "offsetStart" : 0,
      "offsetEnd" : 14,
      "bestDataType" : "tabular data",
      "bestTypeScore" : 0.9956,
      "hasDataset" : 0.9976811408996582
    },
    "data-device" : {
      "rawForm" : "ELISA kit (Mercodia)",
      "normalizedForm" : "ELISA kit (Mercodia)",

    },
    "normalizedForm" : "Insulin levels",
    "context" : "Insulin levels of all samples were measured by ELISA kit (Mercodia)."
  } ],
  "runtime" : 0.901
}
```

Runtimes are expressed in milliseconds.

A `503` error normally means that all the threads available to Softcite service are currently used for processing concurrent requests. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 5 seconds for the `annotateDatasetPDF` service or 3 seconds when disambiguation is also requested.

Using ```curl``` POST request with a __PDF file__:

```console
curl --form input=@./src/test/resources/PMC1636350.pdf --form disambiguate=1 localhost:8060/service/annotateDatasetPDF
```

For PDF, each entity will be associated with a list of bounding box coordinates relative to the PDF, see [here](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Coordinates-in-PDF/#coordinate-system-in-the-pdf) for more explanation about the coordinate system. 

In addition, the response will contain the bibliographical reference information associated to a dataset mention when found. The bibliographical information are provided in XML TEI (similar format as GROBID).
